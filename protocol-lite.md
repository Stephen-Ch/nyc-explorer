## The 95% Rule (Core Gate)

**If confidence is below 95%, STOP and gather evidence.**

| Confidence | Action |
|------------|--------|
| ≥95% | May proceed with implementation |
| <95% | Enter RESEARCH-ONLY mode |

**What 95% confidence means:**
- Verified evidence for every structural assumption
- Know exact files, line ranges, and dependencies affected
- Can predict the outcome with near-certainty

**Handshake phrase:** "Confidence <95% — entering RESEARCH-ONLY mode"

## RESEARCH-ONLY vs INSTRUMENTATION

| Mode | Code Changes | When to Use |
|------|--------------|-------------|
| **RESEARCH-ONLY** | ❌ None | Confidence <95%, investigation without runtime observation |
| **INSTRUMENTATION (CODE-OK)** | ✅ Temporary diagnostics | Need runtime output to diagnose; explicitly approved |

**RESEARCH-ONLY Allowed:** `read_file`, `grep_search`, `git log/diff/status`, SELECT queries, creating `R-###` docs

**RESEARCH-ONLY Forbidden:** Editing runtime code, opening PRs with code changes, builds that modify state

**Prior Research Lookup (MANDATORY):**
- Every RESEARCH-ONLY output MUST search ResearchIndex.md + research/ folder first
- List commands used (rg/grep) + matching R-### IDs found + which were read
- OR state "No relevant prior research found" (only after searching)
- **If missing, the output is INVALID** — stop and add the lookup

**Exiting RESEARCH-ONLY:** Complete an Evidence Pack + confidence ≥95%

→ Full rules: [protocol-v7.md § RESEARCH-ONLY Command Lock](protocol/protocol-v7.md#research-only-command-lock-mandatory)

---

## Evidence Pack (When <95%)

Every research effort produces an **Evidence Pack** in `docs-engineering/research/R-###-<Title>.md`.

**Required sections:**
1. Repro Steps
2. Environment Fingerprint
3. Hard Evidence (DB proof, logs, diff, etc.)
4. Competing Hypotheses
5. Confidence Statement

**Template:** [EVIDENCE-PACK-TEMPLATE.md](templates/EVIDENCE-PACK-TEMPLATE.md)

→ Full rules: [protocol-v7.md § Evidence Pack Requirement](protocol/protocol-v7.md#evidence-pack-requirement-mandatory)

## Green Gate (Stack-Aware)

Run the gate that matches your project type:

| Stack | Gate Command |
|-------|--------------|
| .NET (ASP.NET MVC) | `msbuild LessonWriter2_0.csproj /p:Configuration=Release` |
| JS (if package.json has scripts) | `npm run build` + `npm run test` |
| Docs-only | Population Gate (no TBD/TODO/PLACEHOLDER) |

**LessonWriter2.0:** .NET Gate required. JS Gate N/A (no build script).

## Manual Testing

| Type | When | Format |
|------|------|--------|
| **Quick Smoke** | Non-critical validation | 3 bullets in PR comment |
| **Formal MT** | Acceptance/regression, grading changes | Full checklist artifact |

**Quick Smoke format:**

    **Quick Smoke — PR #NN**
    - [ ] (test 1) — PASS/FAIL
    - [ ] (test 2) — PASS/FAIL
    - [ ] (test 3) — PASS/FAIL
    IDs tested: (list)

**Formal template:** [MANUAL-TEST-TEMPLATE.md](templates/MANUAL-TEST-TEMPLATE.md)

→ Full rules: [protocol-v7.md § Manual Test Checklist Artifact](protocol/protocol-v7.md#manual-test-checklist-artifact-mandatory)

## Approver Workflow (Waiting for Sharad)

**Allowed while PRs await approval:**
- Continue work on feature branches
- Docs-only PRs and commits
- Research and investigation
- Keep branches current (`git merge origin/develop`)

**Not allowed:**
- Merge to develop without approval
- Stack dependent PRs (avoid)
- Assume PR will merge "soon"

**PR Communication:** One Merge Packet comment per PR. If >48h, one polite ping.

**Update NEXT.md:**
- Status: BLOCKED
- Blocked By: PR #NN awaiting approval

## Session Startup (< 2 minutes)

Run through [session-start-checklist.md](session-start-checklist.md):

1. Check NEXT.md status (ACTIVE/PAUSED/BLOCKED)
2. Check open PRs (`gh pr list --state open`)
3. Check for orphan branches
4. Confirm research is indexed

---

## Branch Hygiene

**Check for orphan branches:**

    git branch -a --no-merged origin/develop | Select-String -NotMatch "docs/"

If runtime branches exist without PRs: open PR or document in [branches.md](../status/branches.md).

## Do Not Duplicate

This doc is a quick-reference entrypoint. **Do not add new rules here.**

- All rules live in [protocol-v7.md](protocol/protocol-v7.md)
