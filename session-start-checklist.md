# Session Start Checklist

> **Purpose:** Single-page checklist to reduce "too many places to check" friction.  
> **Usage:** Run through this before starting any work session.  
> **Quick Reference:** See [protocol-lite.md](protocol-lite.md) for core rules summary.

## Pre-Flight Checks (< 2 minutes)

- [ ] **RUN START OF SESSION DOCS AUDIT** — This single command chains: kit update (subtree pull) → forGPT sync → 5-line audit print. Run it first; everything below is verified automatically.
- [ ] **NEXT.md Status** — Open [NEXT.md](../project/NEXT.md). Confirm Status = ACTIVE or PAUSED with clear Next Step.
- [ ] **Open PRs** — Run `gh pr list --state open` or check GitHub. Note any blocking dependencies.
- [ ] **Branch Hygiene** — Run `git branch -a --no-merged origin/develop | Select-String -NotMatch "docs/"`. If runtime branches exist without PRs, address first.
- [ ] **Blockers** — Check [tech-debt-and-future-work.md](../project/tech-debt-and-future-work.md) for known blockers.
- [ ] **Research Index** — Confirm any prior session research is indexed in [ResearchIndex.md](../research/ResearchIndex.md).

## If Any Check Fails

| Check | Action |
|-------|--------|
| NEXT.md unclear | Update NEXT.md before proceeding |
| PRs blocking | Note in prompt; consider docs-only work |
| Orphan branches | Open PR or document why parked |
| Unindexed research | Add to ResearchIndex.md |
