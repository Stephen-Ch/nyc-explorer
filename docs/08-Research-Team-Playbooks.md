## Team A — Time/Space Expansion
**Goal:** widen years & geography with defensible lot timelines and core attractions.
**SOP per Lot:**
1) Verify BBL & geometry; normalize address.
2) Create/extend `lot_timelines` intervals with use_type/name/notes + primary citation.
3) Add/attach Attractions active that Year; write blurb + 3-paragraph essay.
4) Assign Power & Interests; add Events if year-specific.
5) Fact-check by another researcher; editor approves.

**KPIs:** lots with intervals; attractions/km²; % primary-complete; review pass rate.

## Team B — Entertainment Focus
**Entities:** venues, performance_runs, bills_lineup, people (authority IDs).
**SOP per Run:**
1) Confirm venue name-for-year via timeline.
2) Enter run dates; attach playbill/ad (primary); add lineup; resolve people to VIAF/ISNI/LCNAF.
3) Write blurb + 3-paragraph essay; assign Power (premiere/seminal=3).
4) Fact-check; editor approves.

**KPIs:** runs with verified dates, % with primary playbill/ad, people resolved to authority IDs, venue timelines complete.
