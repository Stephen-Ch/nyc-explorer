# Research

This folder holds the research index and any future consolidated research artifacts for NYC Explorer.

## Contents

- [ResearchIndex.md](ResearchIndex.md) — canonical index of all research, audits, postmortems, and investigations

## Rules

- Research items are indexed here by link; physical moves happen only when they reduce scatter without breaking workflows.
- New research artifacts should be filed as `R-NNN-<topic>.md` when created directly in this folder.
- Historical data provenance docs are indexed here but live under `data/historical/` (datasets) or their original locations.
