# Product Vision

**NYC TimeWalk** is a Manhattan walking router that trades a few minutes of speed for a lot more story.
Users select A → B and a **Year**, and we return a route annotated with **Attractions** — events,
venues, businesses, buildings, and historically meaningful moments bound to **lots (BBLs)** and exact years.

## Problem
- Manhattan’s built environment and businesses change rapidly; existing maps are mostly present-day.
- Curious walkers ask: **“What used to be here?”** and **“What happened here?”**

## Solution
- A **year-specific**, **lot-accurate** route that surfaces the **top three** stories per block,
with overflow available, backed by primary citations and clean editorial voice.

## Principles
- **Academic rigor:** primary sources > secondary; explicit confidence per claim.
- **Editorial clarity:** concise blurb → 3-paragraph essay → in-depth history.
- **Transparency:** source each claim; show rights; label contested facts.
- **Accessibility:** desktop-first map; clear icons; shareable route URLs.
- **Respect:** sensitive sites handled with care and policy.
- **Licensing:** public-domain/open assets embedded; others linked with thumbnails.

## Non-goals (MVP)
- No crowdsourced publishing; no mobile AR; no gamification; no paywall beyond freemium slice.

## North-star (v10.x)
- **AR/VR “Time-Travel Performances”**: paid, replayable episodes (e.g., *Sam Cooke at the Copa*),
with historically correct reconstruction and spatial audio.
