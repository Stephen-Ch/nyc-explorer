# Editorial Standards & Citation Guide

## Voice
- Precise, neutral, date-forward. Avoid speculation; label disputes; explain significance.

## Content Ladder
1) **Blurb** (≤200 chars): tight, fact-led hook.
2) **3-paragraph essay**: origin, peak moment, what changed/why it matters.
3) **In-depth**: footnoted narrative with images/maps and extended sources.

## Primary-First Policy
- Every published claim ties to ≥1 **primary source** (property record, atlas, designation report,
tax photo, playbill/ad, contemporary newspaper, etc.). Secondary may supplement context.

## Footnotes
- Chicago-style or MLA; generated from **sources** table fields (archive, call no., URL, rights).
- Each footnote links back to the exact claim (`claim_scope`) it supports.

## Confidence
- Set 0–100; low confidence triggers a visible badge and prevents Power=3 assignment until resolved.

## Rights & Embeds
- Embed only PD/CC0 or permitted CC; otherwise **link-only** with thumbnail if allowed. Always store rights notes.

## Sensitive Sites
- Use neutral language; add context; consider opt-out flags for real-time AR in future versions.
