# Overlay Index

Overlays hold repo-specific truths (branch names, merge ownership, build commands, hot-file lists) so the vibe-coding kit stays generic and portable across repositories.

**Convention:** Overlays live under this repo's docs root: `docs`

## Registered Overlays

| Overlay | File | Purpose |
|---------|------|---------|
| NYC Explorer | [nyc-explorer.md](nyc-explorer.md) | Repo identity, integration branch, build/test commands for Stephen-Ch/nyc-explorer |
