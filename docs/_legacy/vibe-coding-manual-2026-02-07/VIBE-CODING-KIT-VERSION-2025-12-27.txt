Version: 2025-12-27
Repo: DealersChoice (DC-API)
Adopted-from: Mortality kit update pattern
Enhancements: 
- Coverage Checklist + Proof-of-Experience + Bundle warnings policy + Dev-server hygiene
- Version marker maintenance rule (MANDATORY update on any vibe-coding change)

Changes in this version:
- Added maintenance rule to README.md and copilot-instructions-v7.md
- Rule enforces version marker update whenever docs/vibe-coding/ files are modified

Notes:
- docs/vibe-coding is the portable source of truth
- Replace entire folder when a newer marker exists (compare dates)
- Legacy copies in docs/protocol/ are deprecated and point to vibe-coding/
