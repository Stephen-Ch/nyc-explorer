# NYC TimeWalk — One‑Page Pitch
**Tagline:** *Walk Manhattan like it’s 1900—without leaving 2025.*

## The Problem
New Yorkers and visitors constantly ask, **“What used to be here?”** and **“What happened here?”** 
But today’s maps are present‑tense only, and most “history” sites lack **place precision**, **year specificity**, and **primary sources**.

## The Solution
**NYC TimeWalk** is a year‑specific, lot‑accurate walking router for Manhattan. Enter **A → B** and a **Year**; 
we return a route that favors **great stories** within a small **Detour Budget**. Each block shows up to **three** curated **Attractions** 
(venues, businesses, events) with a tight **blurb**, a **3‑paragraph essay**, and **footnoted primary sources**.

## Why We’ll Win
- **Exact Year + Lot (BBL)** — not vague pins. 
- **Primary‑first** rigor with confidence per claim.
- **Interest‑aware routing** — a slider to trade speed for stories.
- **Editor‑set Power (1–3)** keeps the map readable (max 3/block, overflow available).
- **Freemium** launch (one neighborhood × one year) builds audience and trust.

## Who It’s For
Curious walkers, locals, teachers, librarians, tour guides, museum programs, historians, neighborhood groups, and culture fans.

## Post‑MVP Growth
- **Team A:** expand years & neighborhoods (libraries, archives, churches, universities).  
- **Team B (Entertainment):** deep venue histories, setlists, performers—exact runs with playbills and authority IDs.

## North‑Star (v10.x): Time‑Travel Performances (AR/VR)
Buy a front‑row to history—**Sam Cooke at the Copa (1964)** or a Broadway opening night—on‑street AR portals or at‑home VR, 
with transparent rights labels (**Original Master / Re‑performance / Composite**).

## Business Model
- **Free:** one neighborhood × one year, full citations, Save list.  
- **Upgrade:** unlock more years/areas; themed packs (Performance Venues; Restaurants & Businesses); educator bundles.

## What We Need (Teammates)
- **Grad‑researchers (Team A):** lot timelines, citations, confidence calibration.  
- **Grad‑researchers (Team B):** venues, performance runs, playbills, setlists, performer IDs (VIAF/ISNI/LCNAF).  
- **Design/UX:** map clarity, density handling, story tray, Save flow.  
- **Data/Geo:** PostGIS setup, ingestion (PLUTO/LION), block indexing, scoring pipeline.

## Call to Action
