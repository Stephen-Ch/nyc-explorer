# Branches

## Default branches
- `main` — integration branch; always expected to be green in CI.

## Branch naming
- Feature: `feat/<story-id>-<short-desc>`
- Fix: `fix/<story-id>-<short-desc>`
- Chore: `chore/<short-desc>`

## Working agreements
- Keep diffs small and story-scoped.
- Avoid mixing documentation maintenance with runtime changes unless the story explicitly includes both.
