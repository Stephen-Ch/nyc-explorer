✅ Sprint 01 is fixed exactly as below—no creep.

Sprint Goal

Running app at / that loads Union Square / Flatiron (Manhattan) POIs from content/poi.v1.json and renders them on a Leaflet map under tiny-step TDD.

Sprint 01 Backlog (ordered)

SETUP-2 — Minimal API + probe test (DONE ✅)

SCHEMA-5a — Red schema test using inline Zod (fails until data exists)

DATA-4 — Create content/poi.v1.json (8–10 POIs incl. borough, area, block, route_id, order) → flip SCHEMA-5a to GREEN

SETUP-3 — Serve /content/poi.v1.json from the Minimal API

MAP-1a/b — (a) Red e2e expecting markers on / → (b) implement Leaflet (CDN) + fetch to make GREEN
Stretch: OPS-5 — CI job (build + e2e + schema)

Sprint DoD (applies to each item)

Tests-first → RED then GREEN; ≤2 files / ≤60 LOC; only files named in the prompt

Append one line to /docs/code-review.md

Pause after GREEN (await explicit “NEXT” / “PROCEED — P##”)

Risks & notes

Data quality/format for poi.v1.json

CDN availability for Leaflet

Keeping Manhattan + ≤3-POIs-per-block rules visible in prompts
