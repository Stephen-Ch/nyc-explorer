# Code Review Decisions Log — NYC Explorer

**Purpose**  
Track all development decisions in chronological order using the standardized format from Code-Review-Guide_10-24-25.md.

**Format**  
```
[YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM] <REPO>/<BRANCH> <STORY-ID> — <~12 words on what changed> (#tests=<N>, green=<true|false>)
```

**Guidelines**
- Append exactly one line per completed story/PR
- Include test count and green status for traceability
- Keep description to ~12 words focusing on what changed
- Use issue tracker suffix when applicable: `; issue=GH-123` or `; issue=NA`
