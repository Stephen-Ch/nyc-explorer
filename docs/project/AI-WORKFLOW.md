# Stephen ↔ ChatGPT ↔ Copilot Workflow (Prompt-only)

## Roles
- **Stephen (operator):** Chooses intent, scope, priorities, and approves changes.
- **ChatGPT (planner):** Helps draft prompts and check alignment to the Control Deck.
- **Copilot (executor):** Runs commands/edits and must obey the vibe-coding gates.

## Collaboration Loop
1. Read the required docs for the session (see docs/Start-Here-For-AI.md).
2. Run the Start-of-Session Doc Audit and confirm the Control Deck is populated.
3. Use docs/project/NEXT.md as the canonical active plan.
4. Draft a single small work prompt that cites the ACTIVE STORY and NEXT STEP.
5. Copilot executes the prompt and stops after reporting results.
6. After a step is complete, update docs/project/NEXT.md before starting new work.

## When to Pause
Pause immediately if the active story or next step is unclear, if gates fail, or if required artifacts are missing. Use Alignment Mode from the vibe-coding kit to recover.
