# Archive (2026-01-11)

This folder contains documentation that was moved out of the `docs/` root to keep active workflow docs easy to navigate.

## Contents
- `legacy-protocol/` — snapshot of older protocol docs before v7 consolidation
- `sprints/` — Sprint-02 through Sprint-06 plans and postmortems
- `workflow/` — workflow tweak docs that were sprint-specific
- `timewalk/` — TimeWalk research/reference docs captured during earlier project phases
- `historical/` — other one-off historical docs (kickoff, enforcement cheat sheet, system reset notes, etc.)
- `loose/` — non-markdown artifacts kept for reference (e.g., PDFs)
