# Historical Docs (2026-01-11)

Moved from the root of `docs/` to reduce clutter and prevent outdated workflows from looking canonical.

If something in here becomes “active policy” again, consider moving it into the appropriate current location (usually `docs/vibe-coding/`, `docs/status/`, or `docs/testing/`) and update `docs/INDEX.md`.
